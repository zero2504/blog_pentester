Tutorial - How to install Parrot OS on Mac with ARM64 on Parallels and VMWare

### Description:

What am I showing here? I thought I'd join in and write my first tutorial on installing Parrot OS on Apple devices. There are many tutorials for Kali Linux, but few for Parrot OS. I also found that the installation of Kali Linux is much easier and works better than Parrot OS.

Since I made a mistake (the M series is not yet fully developed) and bought a Macbook with an M chip, I am very often stressed in everyday life when it comes to virtualization.

With this tutorial I would like to show you how you can virtualize your Macbook with Parallels (if you want to spend money) or VMWare (Free Beta Version still available -> Technical Preview).

###### What you need:

<u>Virtualization software:</u>

VMWare: https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html 
Parallels: https://www.parallels.com/de/products/ (30 days Trial)

**Note:** 
I will not go into the installation of the respective software, as this would go beyond the scope of this article. But the installation is simple and can be done safely -> see Youtube. 

<u>Operating System:</u>

Parrot OS (Architect Edition) : https://www.parrotsec.org/download/

###### <u>Guide:</u>

1. Create new VM and select the ISO-Image:

2. It does not recognize the operating system for some reason. You can then select the Debian operating system manually.

3. You can now enter a name and change the settings of the VM if you wish. For example, I have assigned 4 GB RAM and 2 cores to the VM (should be sufficient).

5. Now come all the installation steps, such as selecting the language, partitioning the hard drive, etc. 
Go through the steps until you reach "**==Scanning your installation media...==**", from here on we have to deviate from the plan. I didn't install the VM in the graphic install variant because I like the installation more that way haha, but the message is the same in the GUI variant.

6. Now we have to go back and install the GRUB bootloader.

7. As soon as the GRUB boot loader is installed, you must restart the system. You will now be prompted to enter the user name and password you previously set. Don't worry, we will install the desktop environment (and of course the tools).

8. It's just a shame we don't have the internet! But we can do that with a few tricks I found in forums.
<img width="1011" alt="Pasted image 20240315163359" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/81b833c4-f3c0-49ba-870d-63f37a291031">

9. First we want to identify our network interface with `ip addr`
10. Look for something that says link/ether under it, mine was `enp0s5.`
11. Then we configure the whole thing with `sudo dhclient enp0s5`
<img width="1011" alt="Pasted image 20240315163818" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/f6bfbaaf-e322-47a7-9929-c38976983234">

12. Now we need to update and upgrade our VM before it is possible to install the desktop environment, with the following (take a while so chill and get a coffee):
`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
*Note:* 
You may receive a message that the services should be restarted -> simply confirm this and wait until the process is complete. It continues immediately, cool down a little ....
<img width="1011" alt="Pasted image 20240315164829" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/173079cc-2263-48a5-9b44-1d873abe8327">

13. So now we are up to date, yes. Let's finally install the desktop environment. I prefer the Mate variant, but it can also be replaced by XFCE or any other you want.
<img width="1011" alt="Pasted image 20240315165012" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/5ad2a4a1-8f10-4921-97a6-e870de168c46">
This will take even longer now, haha.  Code to install the desktop version:
`sudo apt install parrot-desktop-mate/xfce/gnome/...` 


14. Finally, it's about time. Now we can restart the system with `sudo reboot`:

15. Oh sh.. nice it worked :D
<img width="1027" alt="Pasted image 20240315170054" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/e5e66c1a-ac6b-469e-ad91-43cfff7792ff">

16. Where are all the tools? I want to hack... 
    *Relax, we're installing all the tools now (again, it may take a while depending on your internet speed):*
    `sudo apt install parrot-tools-full`
<img width="1018" alt="Pasted image 20240315170404" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/7bae2d57-4881-4be5-a673-2967850e0c35">

17. Let's go....
<img width="1018" alt="Pasted image 20240315170507" src="https://github.com/zero2504/blog_pentester/assets/84348823/8cf64619-c45e-4bf2-91b0-c1c64ca69880">

18. Finished. Wait we have the newest Version whaaaaaat?

19. Troubleshooting for Macs and installing the Parallels Tools. If you want to use the clipboard between the guest and host or use the shared folders, this link is best.             https://forum.parallels.com/threads/kali-linux-2022-2-parallels-tools-installation.357691/

##### Results:

The process with VMWare is exactly the same and hardly changes. There are also numerous guides for installing VMWare tools, so this should not be a problem. 


If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. The next course will include autocompletion and some optimisations as in Kali Linux.
